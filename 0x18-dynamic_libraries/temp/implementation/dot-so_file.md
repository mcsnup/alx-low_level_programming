# What is a ".so" file?

A `.so` file, also known as a shared object file, is a type of dynamic library file used by Unix/Linux operating systems. It contains executable code and data that can be shared by multiple applications at runtime, making it an efficient way to manage system resources.

Shared object files are loaded into memory by the operating system as needed, allowing multiple applications to access the same code and data without having to duplicate it in each application's memory space. This can lead to significant savings in memory usage and can improve the overall performance of the system.

Shared object files are typically used for system libraries and application plugins, and are often created using programming languages like C and C++. They can be identified by their file extension, which is usually ".so" on Unix/Linux systems.
